[Synapse](https://synapseprotocol.com/) is a interchain messaging protocol & bridge that allows for the creation of decentralized applications that can be deployed across multiple chains. This repo contains a variety of tools, interfaces and services that form the basis of, or are built on top of Synapse.

This repo serves as (or will serve) as the monrepo for all synapse code. Currently, only the [liquidity/bridge contracts](https://github.com/synapsecns/synapse-contracts) still need to be migrated.

## Setup

Clone the repository, open it, and install nodejs packages with `yarn`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/synapsecns/sanguine --recurse-submodules -j10
cd sanguine
yarn install
```


### Install the Correct Version of NodeJS

Using `nvm`, install the correct version of NodeJS.

```
nvm use
```

### Building the TypeScript packages

To build all of the [TypeScript packages](./packages), run:

```bash
yarn clean
yarn build
```

Packages compiled when on one branch may not be compatible with packages on a different branch.
**You should recompile all packages whenever you move from one branch to another.**
Use the above commands to recompile the packages.

## Dealing with submodules

This repo make use of [multiple](.gitattributes) [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). To avoid issues when checking out different branches, you can use `git submodule update --init --recursive` after switching to a branch or `git checkout feat/branch-name --recurse-submodules` when switching branches.

## Contribution workflow
<!-- TODO: this actually belongs in a contributing.md file, but let's be honest, how many people actually read those? -->
<!-- Additionally, the two-branch approach is somewhat temporary, so having this section in the README is probably fine. -->

We use a two-branch strategy for development:

- `master`: This is the primary development branch where all development happens. All regular pull requests (new features, bug fixes, etc) should be opened against this branch.
  - Refer to [Implementing a New Feature](#scenario-1-implementing-a-new-feature) for more details.
- `fe-release`: This branch is used for production front-end releases and is the one that gets deployed to production. The production front-end build always uses the latest commit from this branch.
  - Refer to [Releasing a Front-end Update](#scenario-2-releasing-a-front-end-update) for more details.

> `master` should never be behind `fe-release`! The only exception is when a hotfix is needed on the production front-end.
> Refer to [Hotfixing the Production Front-end](#scenario-3-hotfixing-the-production-front-end) for more details.

We use the following merge strategies:

- **Squash merge**: All pull requests are squash merged into `master`. This keeps the commit history clean and makes it easier to revert changes if necessary.
  > On a very few occasions, we may use a regular merge when `master` needs to be updated with a few commits from `fe-release`. In this case, we will use a regular merge so that there are no merge conflicts when later merging into `fe-release`.
- **Regular merge**: Latest changes from `master` are **regularly merged** into `fe-release`. This ensures that the production front-end always uses the latest changes from `master`, and prevents merge conflicts when merging into `fe-release`.
  > `master` branch should never be the **source branch** when merging into `fe-release`. This is because the source branch is always deleted after merging, and we don't want to delete `master`.

### Scenario 1: Implementing a New Feature

In this scenario you are implementing a new feature that doesn't automatically trigger a front-end release.

1. **Create a new branch**: From the `master` branch, create a new branch for your feature. The branch name should be descriptive of the feature you're implementing.

```bash
git checkout master && git pull
# pkg stands for the package you're working on
git checkout -b pkg/feature-name
```

2. **Implement your feature**: Make your changes in this branch.
3. **Commit your changes**: Regularly commit your changes with clear, concise commit messages.
4. **Push your branch**: When you're ready to open a pull request, push your branch to the remote repository and open a pull request on GitHub. Add an overview of your changes and a link to the relevant issue (if applicable).

```bash
git push -u origin pkg/feature-name
```

5. **Sync with `master`**: If you need to use the latest changes from `master`, you can merge them into your branch. This is especially useful if you're working on a long-running feature branch (or if some tests are failing on your branch, which have been fixed on `master`).

```bash
git checkout master & git pull
git checkout pkg/feature-name
git merge master
```

6. Alternatively, you can rebase your branch on top of `master`. However, this will rewrite your commit history, which can be problematic if other contributors have already pulled your branch or started reviewing your code. The rule of thumb here is:

- If your branch hasn't been pushed yet, **always** rebase.
- If your branch has been pushed, but it is a draft that no one has reviewed yet, you **could** rebase.
- Otherwise, you **should** merge.

```bash
git checkout master & git pull
git checkout pkg/feature-name
# You might need to drop some of your commits here, if they are already in master
# Edit the rebase-todo file to squash, drop, reorder, etc your commits
git rebase -i master
```

7. **CI checks**: Once you've pushed your branch, the CI checks will run automatically. If any of the checks fail, you can fix the issues in your feature branch and push again. The CI checks will run again automatically.
8. **Review and merge**: The PR will be reviewed. If any changes are requested, make them in your feature branch and the PR will automatically update. Once the PR is approved by at least one maintainer, it can be **squash merged** into `master` and your feature branch will be deleted.

### Scenario 2: Releasing a Front-end Update

In this scenario you are releasing a front-end update using the latest changes from `master`.

1. **Create a new branch**: From the `fe-release` branch, create a new branch for the FE release.

```bash
git checkout fe-release && git pull
# Date format is YYYY-MM-DD (sorry my American friends)
git checkout -b release/date
```

2. **Merge `master` into your branch**: This ensures that the production front-end always uses the latest changes from `master`, and prevents merge conflicts when merging into `fe-release`.

```bash
git checkout master && git pull
git checkout release/date
# No merge conflicts should occur here
git merge master
```

3. **Push your branch**: Push your branch to the remote repository and open a pull request on GitHub. No overview is necessary, but you can add links to the PRs that are being released.

```bash
git push -u origin release/date
```

4. **CI checks**: Once you've pushed your branch, the CI checks will run automatically. Assuming that master is passing all checks, your branch should pass all checks as well.
5. **Review and merge**: The PR will be reviewed. Once the PR is approved by at **least two maintainers**, it can be **regularly merged** into `fe-release` and your release branch will be deleted.

### Scenario 3: Hotfixing the Production Front-end

Sometimes, a bug is discovered in the production front-end that needs to be fixed immediately. In this scenario, you are hotfixing the production front-end without using the latest changes from `master`.

1. **Create a new branch**: From the `fe-release` branch, create a new branch for the hotfix.

```bash
git checkout fe-release && git pull
# Date format is YYYY-MM-DD (sorry my American friends)
git checkout -b hotfix/date
```

2. **Implement your hotfix**: Make your changes in this branch.

3. **Push your branch**: Push your branch to the remote repository and open a pull request on GitHub.

```bash
git push -u origin hotfix/date
```

4. **CI checks**: Once you've pushed your branch, the CI checks will run automatically. Depending on the severity of the hotfix, you might want to merge the PR as soon or before it passes all checks. However, **you should wait for the linting checks to pass**, as these are the fastest and easiest to fix.

5. **Review and merge**: The PR will be reviewed. Once the PR is approved by at **least two maintainers**, it can be **squash merged** into `fe-release` and your hotfix branch will be deleted.

6. Take a deep breath and relax. You've just saved the day. 🦸‍♂️

7. **Catch up `master`**: now that the hotfix is released, you should catch up `master` with the latest changes from `fe-release`. This ensures that `master` branch is never behind `fe-release`.

```bash
git checkout fe-release && git pull
git checkout master && git pull
git checkout -b catchup/date
git merge fe-release
```

8. **Push your branch**: Push your `catchup/date` branch to the remote repository and open a pull request on GitHub.

```bash
git push -u origin catchup/date
```

9. **CI checks**: Once you've pushed your branch, the CI checks will run automatically. Assuming that `fe-release` is passing all checks, your branch should pass all checks as well.

10. **Review and merge**: The PR will be reviewed. Once the PR is approved by at **least one maintainer**, it can be **regularly merged** into `master` and your catchup branch will be deleted.

In order to minimize risks coming from extraneous dependencies or supply chain attacks in a production like environment, all distributed images are built as [scratch](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch) or [distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless#distroless-container-images) images. Builder containers are also not used to restrict the build environment to the [goreleaser container](https://github.com/synapsecns/sanguine/pkgs/container/sanguine-goreleaser). All production images are kept in the `docker/` file as `[dir].Dockerfile`. Local
