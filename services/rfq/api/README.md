# RFQ API

This is the canonical implementation of the RFQ API. It is a RESTful API that allows solvers to post quotes for given bridge routes.

## Example

To retrieve quotes,

```bash
curl -X 'GET''http://api.synapseprotocol.com/quotes' -H 'accept: application/json'
```

For complete API documentation, including additional endpoints and query parameters, please refer to the [API Documentation](http://api.synapseprotocol.com/api-docs).
