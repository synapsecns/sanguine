(See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n  /**\n   * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n   * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n   *\n   * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n   * ordering also apply here.\n   *\n   * Emits an {Approval} event.\n   *\n   * Requirements:\n   *\n   * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n   * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n   * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n   * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n   * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n   *\n   * For more information on the signature format, see the\n   * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n   * section].\n   *\n   * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n   */\n  function permit(\n    address owner,\n    address spender,\n    uint256 value,\n    uint256 deadline,\n    uint8 v,\n    bytes32 r,\n    bytes32 s\n  ) external;\n\n  /**\n   * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

module that allows children to implement role-based access control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see {AccessControlEnumerable}. Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed in the external API and be unique.

By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't\n * need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.\n *\n * ==== Security Considerations\n *\n * There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature\n * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be\n * considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have\n * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should\n * take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\n * generally recommended is:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\n *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\n *     doThing(..., value);\n * }\n *\n * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\n *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\n * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n  /**\n   * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n   * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n   *\n   * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n   * ordering also apply here.\n   *\n   * Emits an {Approval} event.\n   *\n   * Requirements:\n   *\n   * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n   * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n   * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n   * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n   * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n   *\n   * For more information on the signature format, see the\n   * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n   * section].\n   *\n   * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n   */\n  function permit(\n    address owner,\n    address spender,\n    uint256 value,\n    uint256 deadline,\n    uint8 v,\n    bytes32 r,\n    bytes32 s\n  ) external;\n\n  /**\n   * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

(See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n  /**\n   * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n   * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n   *\n   * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n   * ordering also apply here.\n   *\n   * Emits an {Approval} event.\n   *\n   * Requirements:\n   *\n   * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n   * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n   * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n   * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n   * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n   *\n   * For more information on the signature format, see the\n   * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n   * section].\n   *\n   * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n   */\n  function permit(\n    address owner,\n    address spender,\n    uint256 value,\n    uint256 deadline,\n    uint8 v,\n    bytes32 r,\n    bytes32 s\n  ) external;\n\n  /**\n   * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\n * generally recommended is:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\n *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\n *     doThing(..., value);\n * }\n *\n * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\n *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\n * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n  /**\n   * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n   * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n   *\n   * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n   * ordering also apply here.\n   *\n   * Emits an {Approval} event.\n   *\n   * Requirements:\n   *\n   * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n   * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n   * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n   * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n   * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n   *\n   * For more information on the signature format, see the\n   * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n   * section].\n   *\n   * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n   */\n  function permit(\n    address owner,\n    address spender,\n    uint256 value,\n    uint256 deadline,\n    uint8 v,\n    bytes32 r,\n    bytes32 s\n  ) external;\n\n  /**\n   * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't\n * need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.\n *\n * ==== Security Considerations\n *\n * There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature\n * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be\n * considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have\n * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should\n * take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\n * generally recommended is:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\n *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\n *     doThing(..., value);\n * }\n *\n * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\n *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\n * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n  /**\n   * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n   * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n   *\n   * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n   * ordering also apply here.\n   *\n   * Emits an {Approval} event.\n   *\n   * Requirements:\n   *\n   * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n   * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n   * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n   * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n   * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n   *\n   * For more information on the signature format, see the\n   * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n   * section].\n   *\n   * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n   */\n  function permit(\n    address owner,\n    address spender,\n    uint256 value,\n    uint256 deadline,\n    uint8 v,\n    bytes32 r,\n    bytes32 s\n  ) external;\n\n  /**\n   * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't\n * need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.\n *\n * ==== Security Considerations\n *\n * There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature\n * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be\n * considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have\n * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should\n * take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\n * generally recommended is:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\n *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\n *     doThing(..., value);\n * }\n *\n * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\n *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\n * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n  /**\n   * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n   * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n   *\n   * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n   * ordering also apply here.\n   *\n   * Emits an {Approval} event.\n   *\n   * Requirements:\n   *\n   * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n   * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n   * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n   * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n   * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n   *\n   * For more information on the signature format, see the\n   * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n   * section].\n   *\n   * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n   */\n  function permit(\n    address owner,\n    address spender,\n    uint256 value,\n    uint256 deadline,\n    uint8 v,\n    bytes32 r,\n    bytes32 s\n  ) external;\n\n  /**\n   * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\n * generally recommended is:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\n *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\n *     doThing(..., value);\n * }\n *\n * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\n *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\n * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n  /**\n   * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n   * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n   *\n   * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n   * ordering also apply here.\n   *\n   * Emits an {Approval} event.\n   *\n   * Requirements:\n   *\n   * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n   * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n   * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n   * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n   * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n   *\n   * For more information on the signature format, see the\n   * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n   * section].\n   *\n   * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n   */\n  function permit(\n    address owner,\n    address spender,\n    uint256 value,\n    uint256 deadline,\n    uint8 v,\n    bytes32 r,\n    bytes32 s\n  ) external;\n\n  /**\n   * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

(See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n  /**\n   * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n   * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n   *\n   * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n   * ordering also apply here.\n   *\n   * Emits an {Approval} event.\n   *\n   * Requirements:\n   *\n   * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n   * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n   * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n   * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n   * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n   *\n   * For more information on the signature format, see the\n   * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n   * section].\n   *\n   * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n   */\n  function permit(\n    address owner,\n    address spender,\n    uint256 value,\n    uint256 deadline,\n    uint8 v,\n    bytes32 r,\n    bytes32 s\n  ) external;\n\n  /**\n   * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

(See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n  /**\n   * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n   * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n   *\n   * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n   * ordering also apply here.\n   *\n   * Emits an {Approval} event.\n   *\n   * Requirements:\n   *\n   * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n   * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n   * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n   * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n   * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n   *\n   * For more information on the signature format, see the\n   * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n   * section].\n   *\n   * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n   */\n  function permit(\n    address owner,\n    address spender,\n    uint256 value,\n    uint256 deadline,\n    uint8 v,\n    bytes32 r,\n    bytes32 s\n  ) external;\n\n  /**\n   * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't\n * need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.\n *\n * ==== Security Considerations\n *\n * There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature\n * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be\n * considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have\n * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should\n * take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\n * generally recommended is:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\n *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\n *     doThing(..., value);\n * }\n *\n * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\n *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\n * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n  /**\n   * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n   * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n   *\n   * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n   * ordering also apply here.\n   *\n   * Emits an {Approval} event.\n   *\n   * Requirements:\n   *\n   * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n   * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n   * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n   * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n   * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n   *\n   * For more information on the signature format, see the\n   * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n   * section].\n   *\n   * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n   */\n  function permit(\n    address owner,\n    address spender,\n    uint256 value,\n    uint256 deadline,\n    uint8 v,\n    bytes32 r,\n    bytes32 s\n  ) external;\n\n  /**\n   * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

(See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n  /**\n   * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n   * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n   *\n   * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n   * ordering also apply here.\n   *\n   * Emits an {Approval} event.\n   *\n   * Requirements:\n   *\n   * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n   * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n   * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n   * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n   * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n   *\n   * For more information on the signature format, see the\n   * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n   * section].\n   *\n   * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n   */\n  function permit(\n    address owner,\n    address spender,\n    uint256 value,\n    uint256 deadline,\n    uint8 v,\n    bytes32 r,\n    bytes32 s\n  ) external;\n\n  /**\n   * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

The first is that a valid permit signature\n * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be\n * considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have\n * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should\n * take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail.

(See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n  /**\n   * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n   * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n   *\n   * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n   * ordering also apply here.\n   *\n   * Emits an {Approval} event.\n   *\n   * Requirements:\n   *\n   * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n   * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n   * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n   * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n   * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n   *\n   * For more information on the signature format, see the\n   * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n   * section].\n   *\n   * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n   */\n  function permit(\n    address owner,\n    address spender,\n    uint256 value,\n    uint256 deadline,\n    uint8 v,\n    bytes32 r,\n    bytes32 s\n  ) external;\n\n  /**\n   * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

The first is that a valid permit signature\n * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be\n * considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have\n * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should\n * take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\n * generally recommended is:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\n *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\n *     doThing(..., value);\n * }\n *\n * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\n *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\n * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n  /**\n   * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n   * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n   *\n   * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n   * ordering also apply here.\n   *\n   * Emits an {Approval} event.\n   *\n   * Requirements:\n   *\n   * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n   * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n   * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n   * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n   * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n   *\n   * For more information on the signature format, see the\n   * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n   * section].\n   *\n   * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n   */\n  function permit(\n    address owner,\n    address spender,\n    uint256 value,\n    uint256 deadline,\n    uint8 v,\n    bytes32 r,\n    bytes32 s\n  ) external;\n\n  /**\n   * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

(See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n  /**\n   * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n   * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n   *\n   * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n   * ordering also apply here.\n   *\n   * Emits an {Approval} event.\n   *\n   * Requirements:\n   *\n   * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n   * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n   * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n   * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n   * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n   *\n   * For more information on the signature format, see the\n   * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n   * section].\n   *\n   * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n   */\n  function permit(\n    address owner,\n    address spender,\n    uint256 value,\n    uint256 deadline,\n    uint8 v,\n    bytes32 r,\n    bytes32 s\n  ) external;\n\n  /**\n   * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

(See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n  /**\n   * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n   * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n   *\n   * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n   * ordering also apply here.\n   *\n   * Emits an {Approval} event.\n   *\n   * Requirements:\n   *\n   * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n   * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n   * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n   * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n   * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n   *\n   * For more information on the signature format, see the\n   * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n   * section].\n   *\n   * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n   */\n  function permit(\n    address owner,\n    address spender,\n    uint256 value,\n    uint256 deadline,\n    uint8 v,\n    bytes32 r,\n    bytes32 s\n  ) external;\n\n  /**\n   * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

(See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n  /**\n   * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n   * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n   *\n   * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n   * ordering also apply here.\n   *\n   * Emits an {Approval} event.\n   *\n   * Requirements:\n   *\n   * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n   * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n   * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n   * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n   * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n   *\n   * For more information on the signature format, see the\n   * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n   * section].\n   *\n   * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n   */\n  function permit(\n    address owner,\n    address spender,\n    uint256 value,\n    uint256 deadline,\n    uint8 v,\n    bytes32 r,\n    bytes32 s\n  ) external;\n\n  /**\n   * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\n * generally recommended is:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\n *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\n *     doThing(..., value);\n * }\n *\n * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\n *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\n * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n  /**\n   * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n   * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n   *\n   * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n   * ordering also apply here.\n   *\n   * Emits an {Approval} event.\n   *\n   * Requirements:\n   *\n   * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n   * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n   * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n   * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n   * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n   *\n   * For more information on the signature format, see the\n   * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n   * section].\n   *\n   * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n   */\n  function permit(\n    address owner,\n    address spender,\n    uint256 value,\n    uint256 deadline,\n    uint8 v,\n    bytes32 r,\n    bytes32 s\n  ) external;\n\n  /**\n   * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\n * generally recommended is:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\n *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\n *     doThing(..., value);\n * }\n *\n * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\n *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\n * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n  /**\n   * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n   * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n   *\n   * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n   * ordering also apply here.\n   *\n   * Emits an {Approval} event.\n   *\n   * Requirements:\n   *\n   * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n   * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n   * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n   * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n   * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n   *\n   * For more information on the signature format, see the\n   * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n   * section].\n   *\n   * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n   */\n  function permit(\n    address owner,\n    address spender,\n    uint256 value,\n    uint256 deadline,\n    uint8 v,\n    bytes32 r,\n    bytes32 s\n  ) external;\n\n  /**\n   * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.
