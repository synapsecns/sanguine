# CCTP Relayer

r

The CCTP Relayer is designed to work with the [CCTP Contracts](https://github.com/synapsecns/synapse-contracts/tree/feat/cctp) in order to permissionlessly facilitate cross-chain, slippage free, transactions using Circles [CCTP api](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoin/docs/cctp-getting-started).
