At a high level, the canonical implementation of the relayer has 3 different responsibilities.

- **Quoting** - Keep track of balances on each chain as well as in-flight funds and continuously post-quotes with these balances using the config to adjust quotes to the solvers specifications and posting to the API.
- **Relaying -** Fulfill users [BridgeRequests](https://vercel-rfq-docs.vercel.app/contracts/interfaces/IFastBridge.sol/interface.IFastBridge.html#bridgerequested) by relaying their funds on-chain. Once eligible, claim the users funds on the origin chain.
- **Rebalancing -** In order to handle the complexity of user flows, the Relayer provides an interface that allows funds to be rebalanced. This allows RFQ to be reflexive to cases where flows are mono-directional.

## Architecture

The relayer is a Golang application that polls for events on chain and uses a combo state (db status) and event (on-chain logs) driven architecture to process transactions. The relayer has 3 different event loops going at any given time, specified above and elaborated on below:

### Quoting
The quoting loop is comparitively simple and updates the api on each route it supports. Quotes are posted using the following formula:

 - **Do not quote above available balance**: Available balance is determined by `balance on chain - in-flight funds`. If the token is the gas token, then the minimum gas token amount is subtracted. The relayer will also not post quotes below the `min_quote_amount` specified in the config.
 - **Quote offset**: The quote offset is a percentage of the price of the token. This is used to ensure that the relayer is profitable. The quote offset is added to the price of the token to determine the quote price.
 - **Fee**: The fee is determined by the `fixed_fee_multiplier` in the config. This is multiplied by the `origin_gas_estimate`  and `destination_gas_estimate` to determine the fee. This fee is added to the quote price.

### Rebalancing

The rebalancing loop is more complex and is responsible for ensuring that the relayer has enough liquidity on each chain. Right now only the CCTP rebalancer is supported and works like this:

1. At `rebalance_interval`, check the `maintenance_balance_pct` of each token on each chain and compare it to the current balance. If the balance is below the `maintenance_balance_pct`, continue
2. Calculate the amount to rebalance by taking the difference between the maintenance balance and the current balance and multiplying it by the `initial_balance_pct`.
3. If the amount to rebalance is greater than the `max_rebalance_amount`, set the amount to rebalance to the `max_rebalance_amount`. If the amount to rebalance is less than the `min_rebalance_amount`, do not rebalance.
4. Repeat after `rebalance_interval`

### Relaying

The relaying loop is the most complex and is responsible for relaying funds on-chain. The relayer listens to events on-chain and status updates in the database to take move transactions through the states. The states are as follows:

1. An on-chain transaction emits the event [`BridgeRequested`](https://vercel-rfq-docs.vercel.app/contracts/interfaces/IFastBridge.sol/interface.IFastBridge.html#bridgerequested). We store this event in the db with the status [`Seen`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/synapsecns/sanguine/services/rfq/relayer/reldb#Seen).
1. Check if the request is valid, If not, it is marked as [`WillNotProcess`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/synapsecns/sanguine/services/rfq/relayer/reldb#WillNotProcess)
1. Check if there's enough inventory, if not mark as [`NotEnoughInventory`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/synapsecns/sanguine/services/rfq/relayer/reldb#NotEnoughInventory) and try again later.
1. If these checks pass, it's stored as [`CommittedPending`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/synapsecns/sanguine/services/rfq/relayer/reldb#CommittedPending). This will automatically reduce the next quote amount posted to the api since the relayers liquidity has been committed.
1. Check the chain to see if transaction is finalized yet, if not wait until it is.
1. Once the transaction is finalized on chain, update the status to [`CommitedConfirmed`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/synapsecns/sanguine/services/rfq/relayer/reldb#CommitedConfirmed). This means the transaction is finalized on chain and we can now relay it to the destination chain.
1. Call [`relay`](https://vercel-rfq-docs.vercel.app/contracts/FastBridge.sol/contract.FastBridge.html#relay) on the contract to relay the transaction and update the status to  [`RelayPending`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/synapsecns/sanguine/services/rfq/relayer/reldb#RelayPending)
1. Listen for the relay in the logs. Once we get it we mark the transaction as [`RelayComplete`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/synapsecns/sanguine/services/rfq/relayer/reldb#RelayComplete)
1. Call [`Prove()`](https://vercel-rfq-docs.vercel.app/contracts/FastBridge.sol/contract.FastBridge.html#prove) on the contract to prove that we relayed the transaction. Once this is done, we mark the transaction as [`ProvePosting`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/synapsecns/sanguine/services/rfq/relayer/reldb#ProvePosting)
1. Wait for the dispute period to expire. Once it does call [`claim`](https://vercel-rfq-docs.vercel.app/contracts/FastBridge.sol/contract.FastBridge.html#claim) mark the transaction as [`ClaimPending`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/synapsecns/sanguine/services/rfq/relayer/reldb#ClaimPending)
1. Wait for the dispute period to expire. Once it does mark the transaction as [`ClaimComplete`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/synapsecns/sanguine/services/rfq/relayer/reldb#ClaimComplete)

## Running a Relayer

### Building From Source

To build the relayer from source, you will need to have Go installed. You can install Go by following the instructions [here](https://golang.org/doc/install). Once you have Go installed, you can build the relayer by running the following commands:

1. `git clone https://github.com/synapsecns/sanguine --recursive`
2. `cd sanguine/services/rfq/relayer`
3. `go run main.go --config /path/to/config.yaml`

### Running the Docker Image

The relayer can also be run with docker. To do this, you will need to pull the [docker image](https://github.com/synapsecns/sanguine/pkgs/container/sanguine%2Frfq-relayer) and run it with the config file:

```bash
docker run ghcr.io/synapsecns/sanguine/rfq-relayer:latest --config /path/to/config
```

### Configuration

   -  `type` - the database driver to use, can be `mysql` or `sqlite`.
   -  `dsn` - the dsn of your database. If using sqlite, this can be a path, if using mysql please see [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-odbc/en/connector-odbc-configuration.html) for more information.
 - `screener_api_url` (optional) -  Please see [here](https://github.com/synapsecns/sanguine/tree/master/contrib/screener-api#screening-api) for an api spec, this is used descision on wether to bridge to given addresses.
 - `rfq_url` - URL of the rfq api, please see the [API](../API#api-urls) page for details and the mainnet/testnet urls.
 - `omnirpc_url` - URL of omnirpc to use, Please see [here](../../Services/Omnirpc) for details on running an omnirpc instance.
 - `rebalance_interval` - How often to rebalance, formatted as (s = seconds, m = minutes, h = hours)
 - `relayer_api_port` - the relayer api is used to control the relayer. <!--TODO: more info here--> This api should be secured/not public.
 - `base_chain_config`: Base chain config is the default config applied for each chain if the other chains do not override it. This is covered in the chains section.
 - `chains` - each chain has a different config that overrides base_chain_config. Here are the parameters for each chain
  - `rfq_address` - the address of the rfq contract on this chain. These addresses are available [here](../Contracts.md).

  - `synapse_cctp_address` (optional) - this is only applicable if **rebalance_method** is set to synapse. This is the address of the CCTP contract available [here](../../CCTP/Contracts).
  - `token_messenger_address` (optional) -  this is only applicable if **rebalance_method** is set to cctp. Tells the relayer to use the token messenger instead of synapse.
      <aside>
      💡 The choice of wether to use synapse cctp or the circle token messenger is up to the user. Synapse will take a fee but unlike the token messenger, will not spend any of the users gas.
      </aside>
  - `confirmations` - how many confirmations to wait before acting on an event. This will vary per-chain.
  - `tokens` - this is a map of token symbol→token info for this chain. For example, token may be USDC, ETH, etc

### Observability

The RFQ relayer implements open telemetry for both tracing and metrics. Please see the [Observability](../../Observability) page for more info. There is also a custom [grafana dashboard](https://github.com/synapsecns/sanguine/tree/master/services/rfq/relayer/dashboards/grafana.json) available for the relayer.
