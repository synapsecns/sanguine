### On-Chain Architecture & Transaction Flow

The RFQ contract allows users to post bridge requests based on quotes they have received from the solvers. At a high level, the contract works as follows:

1. **User calls bridge**: The user calls the bridge contract with the quote they have received from the RFQ API and passing in origin, destination and other paramaters as a [BridgeParam](https://vercel-rfq-docs.vercel.app/contracts/interfaces/IFastBridge.sol/interface.IFastBridge.html#bridgeparams).
2. **Bridge emits event**: The bridge contract emits a [`BridgeRequested`](https://vercel-rfq-docs.vercel.app/contracts/interfaces/IFastBridge.sol/interface.IFastBridge.html#bridgerequested) event.
3. **Solver relays request**: The solver relays the request by calling the [`relay`](https://vercel-rfq-docs.vercel.app/contracts/FastBridge.sol/contract.FastBridge.html#relay) function on the RFQ contract. The contract then pulls the tokens from the solvers wallet (or [msg.value](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/43362/what-is-msg-value) in the case of eth) and sends them to the user filling their order.
4. **Solver Calls Prove**: The solver then calls the [`prove`](https://vercel-rfq-docs.vercel.app/contracts/FastBridge.sol/contract.FastBridge.html#prove) function on the RFQ contract to prove they have filled the order.
5. **User Claims**: If the solver does not call prove within the optimistic window, the user can call the [`claim`](https://vercel-rfq-docs.vercel.app/contracts/FastBridge.sol/contract.FastBridge.html#claim) function to claim their funds back.

### On-Chain Statuses

Like the relayer, each transaction in the RFQ contract has a status. The statuses are as follows:

| Status          | Int | Meaning                                                                                                                                                               |
|-----------------|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Null            | 0   | Bridge transaction doesn't exist yet on the origin chain.                                                                                                             |
| Requested       | 1   | A bridge has been requested, but the [`prove`](https://vercel-rfq-docs.vercel.app/contracts/FastBridge.sol/contract.FastBridge.html#prove) has not yet been called    |
| Relayer Proved  | 2   | The relayer has tried to [`prove`](https://vercel-rfq-docs.vercel.app/contracts/FastBridge.sol/contract.FastBridge.html#prove) the transaction, but cannot claim yet. |
| Relayer Claimed | 3   | The relayer has called [`claim`](https://vercel-rfq-docs.vercel.app/contracts/FastBridge.sol/contract.FastBridge.html#claim) and gotten the funds.                    |
| Refunded        | 4   | The relayer has not called `claim` within the optimistic period or a dispute has been decided in favor of the user and the users been refunded.                       |
