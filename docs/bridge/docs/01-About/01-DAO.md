# Synapse DAO

Since launch of the Synapse Protocol, a number of governance initiatives have been put forward and voted on by the Synapse DAO.

## Governance Model

SYN holders with more than 100,000 SYN tokens can put forward proposals to be voted on by the DAO. SYN holders can vote using SYN on multiple chains, or delegate their votes to other token holders. 

In order to be adopted by the DAO, a proposal must gather at least `50% + 1` of all votes and reach the minimum quorum of 5 million SYN tokens.

## Governance Components

* **[Forum](https://forum.synapseprotocol.com/)**: A Platform to post proposals for discussion before an official vote
* **[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/synapseprotocol.eth)**: A decentralized governance platform for conducting official votes.
* **[Discord](https://discord.gg/synapseprotocol)**: Discussion channel for general Synapse matters
