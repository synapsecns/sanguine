# Synapse DAO

[Synapse Protocol](https://synapseprotocol.com/), [Hypercall](https://hypercall.xyz/) and [Cortex Protocol](https://cortexprotocol.com/) are governed by the Synapse DAO.

Since the launch of [SIP-43](https://snapshot.box/#/s:synapseprotocol.eth/proposal/0x274e0c14be2a62c2a293a0cade4560481ab8da183e66d250ed9c8cdd9bbd5b4e), the Synapse DAO can also be referred to as the Cortex DAO.

## Governance Model

SYN holders with more than 550,000 SYN tokens can put forward proposals to be voted on by the DAO. SYN holders can vote using SYN on multiple chains, or delegate their votes to other token holders.

SYN is listed on major exchanges including Binance and Kraken.

In order to be adopted by the DAO, a proposal must gather at least `50% + 1` of all votes and reach the minimum quorum of 2.25 million SYN tokens.

## Governance Components

* **[Snapshot](https://snapshot.box/#/s:cortex-protocol.ethh)**: A decentralized governance platform for conducting official votes.
