# Cortex DAO

Synapse Protocol is governed by the Cortex DAO. Since launch of the Synapse Protocol, a number of governance initiatives have been put forward and voted on by the Synapse DAO, and as part of [SIP - 43](https://snapshot.box/#/s:synapseprotocol.eth/proposal/0x274e0c14be2a62c2a293a0cade4560481ab8da183e66d250ed9c8cdd9bbd5b4e), all IP and governance rights have been transferred to the Cortex DAO.

## Governance Model

CX holders with more than 550,000 CX tokens can put forward proposals to be voted on by the DAO. CX holders can vote using CX on multiple chains, or delegate their votes to other token holders. SYN holders can convert their SYN to CX in the [conversion portal](https://cortexprotocol.com/convert) and vote on proposals.

In order to be adopted by the DAO, a proposal must gather at least `50% + 1` of all votes and reach the minimum quorum of 2.25 million CX tokens.
