Due to various factors, it is possible but uncommon for a bridge to go unfilled, where it is indefinitely not relayed.

In these situations, the [User]'s funds will remain safely in escrow on the FastBridge contract until a [cancel] function is executed. This function can be executed permissionlessly after a [Cancel Delay] period has passed.

A permissioned [Canceler] entity can also execute the [cancel] function prior to the cancellation delay, but only after the relay expiration [deadline](https://rfq-contracts.synapseprotocol.com/contracts/interfaces/IFastBridge.sol/interface.IFastBridge.html#bridgeparams) indicated the BridgeParams of the bridge request. This allows cancellations to occur more rapidly when appropriate, at the discretion of the [Canceler].

If there is already a [proof] on file for the transaction, then cancellation will be prevented. (IE: Cannot attempt to [cancel] a transaction which appears to have already been successfully completed)

### Effects of a cancel transaction

Regardless of the manner of cancellation, the [User]'s escrowed funds will be transferred from FastBridge back to the `originSender` of the original bridge transaction.

Additionally, a [BridgeDepositRefunded](https://rfq-contracts.synapseprotocol.com/contracts/interfaces/IFastBridge.sol/interface.IFastBridge.html#bridgedepositrefunded) event will be emitted.

No further action is possible with the bridge after a cancellation and it can be considered closed.
