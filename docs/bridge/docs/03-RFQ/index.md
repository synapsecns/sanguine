# Synapse Intent Network

Synapse Intent Network (SIN) is an RFQ (Request-For-Quote) based <abbr title="'Intent' refers to a user authorizing specific actions that they want to achieve, typically in very simple terms, such as a bridge or swap. Actual execution of the actions is then performed on the user's behalf by third parties known as solvers/relayers.">intent</abbr> centric bridging system that connects bridging users to a network of relayers.

These relayers compete to provide the optimal bridge execution (eg: the best price) for the user's specific request.

## Architecture

### Quoter API
The RESTful [Quoter API] allows Quoters to post Passive and/or Active Quotes.
These quotes are then used to create transactions for Users to sign and submit.

### FastBridge Smart Contracts
[Synapse FastBridge contracts](/docs/Contracts/RFQ) facilitate and enforce all of the on-chain functionality and security of the system.

This includes the bridge, deposit, escrow, and eventual release of user funds on the origin chain.

Associated [relay], [prove], [claim], [dispute], and [cancel] actions are also facilitated by FastBridge contracts.

Additionally, the FastBridge contracts manage all relevant permissions and on-chain configuration settings of the system.

FastBridge contracts will be deployed on all supported chains.


##  Flow Summary

#### [Quoting]
<blockquote>
A [User] inputs their desired bridge information into an bridge interface such as [Synapse](https://synapseprotocol.com/?fromChainId=1).

Quotes to complete the bridge are collected from [Quoters]. The best of these is resolved and presented to the user as a bridge transaction to sign & submit on-chain.
</blockquote>

#### [Bridging]
<blockquote>
Once the [User] has signed and submitted their deposit on-chain via a bridge transaction, the bridging funds will be transferred to a FastBridge contract and held in escrow.

</blockquote>

#### [Relaying]

<blockquote>
Relayers who observe the bridge deposit event can permissionlessly complete the bridge by calling [relay] on the FastBridge contract of the destination chain. Typically the Relayer is the same as the Quoter.

This will transfer the bridge destination funds from the [Relayer] to the [User], with FastBridge acting as intermediary.

At this point, the process is complete from the [User]'s perspective. However, the [Relayer] needs to be reimbursed for the funds they delivered.
</blockquote>

#### [Proving]

<blockquote>

After the relay, a [Prover] (typically also the Relayer) will submit a [prove] transaction with the relay transaction's details to the origin chain's FastBridge contract.

This asserts that the [relay] for the bridge was completed according to the specifications of the [User], and that the [Relayer] can rightfully [claim] the escrowed funds.

A [Dispute Period] begins for the transaction before the [claim] can occur.

</blockquote>

#### [Dispute Period]

<blockquote>
During the [Dispute Period], [Guard] entities will verify that the proof's assertion is accurate.

IE: They will confirm that the [relay] being asserted was completed exactly as specified by the user.

If any discrepancies are found, the guards will [dispute] the proof
</blockquote>

#### [Claiming]

<blockquote>
Once the [Dispute Period] has passed without incident, a [claim] transaction can be executed by the [Relayer] on the origin chain.

This willrelease the deposit funds from escrow and deliver them to the rightful [Relayer] as a reimbursement for the liquidity they provided on the [relay].
