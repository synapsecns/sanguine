The Synapse Intent Network (SIN) systems allows [Quoter] entities (aka market makers / solvers / relayers) to post quotes via an off-chain [Quoter API]. These quotes are matched to `User` bridge inputs to achieve the optimal parameters (eg: the best price) for the [User]'s bridge transaction.

There are two types of quoting methods supported by the Synapse Intent Network (SIN) system:

## [Passive Quoting](/docs/RFQ/Quoting/Quoter%20API/#passive-quotes)

Similar to an order book, Passive Quoting communicates a [Quoter]'s ongoing intention to fulfill any transaction that occurs upon specific routes and meets specific limits, pricing, and fee criteria.

## [Active Quoting](/docs/RFQ/Quoting/Quoter%20API/#active-quotes)

In our latest version of the [Quoter API], a new Active Quoting method has been introduced where a [Quoter] can listen and respond to live quote requests individually.

This supplements the existing Passive Quotes to create a hybrid system, where Active and Passive quoting can be utilized together by Quoters in any desired combination to maximize their efficiency and further improve prices.

Active quoting is more complicated to implement and maintain, but allow for more granular & customized quotes that can improve efficiency among other benefits. Quoters who prefer a simpler approach are free to use nothing but Passive Quotes, if they choose.

:::

Regardless of the method used, these quotes constitute a provisional commitment to fulfill a [User]'s bridge according to the quoted price and other parameters, once it is submitted on-chain.

To that end, integrators and users can utilize the data from these quotes to construct and submit a [Bridging] transaction on-chain. Once this transaction is finalized on-chain, `User`s can expect to receive their funds on the destination shortly after, as quoted.

Quoters are responsible for keeping their quotes fresh and accurate. Likewise, they are responsible for completing their part of fulfillment for any transactions which act upon their quotes. To these effects, Quoters should push updates as rapidly as possible in reaction to consequential changes in prices, balances, etc. By default, the [Canonical Relayer](/docs/RFQ/CanonicalRelayer/) continuously updates quotes by checking on-chain balances, in-flight requests, and gas prices - custom implementations should take a similar approach.
