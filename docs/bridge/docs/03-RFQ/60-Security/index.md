Synapse Intent Network (SIN) is an optimistic cross-chain system. This means that any ambiguous actions in the system are assumed to be accurate and honest by default unless they are challenged/disputed within a short timeframe.


### Proofs

With this system in particular, [prove] transactions are the focal point of this optimistic mechanism - whereby a [Relayer] is asserting that they completed a [relay] and can rightfully [claim] the escrowed bridge funds as a reimbursement.

Each [prove] transaction sets the [proof] data for the bridge and initiates a dispute period.


### Dispute Period

After a [prove] transaction is posted and the [proof] data is set, a window of time called the [Dispute Period](https://rfq-contracts.synapseprotocol.com/contracts/FastBridgeV2.sol/contract.FastBridgeV2.html#dispute_period) begins.

During this time, the prove/proof is eligible to be disputed by [Guard] entities.

After the [Dispute Period](https://rfq-contracts.synapseprotocol.com/contracts/FastBridgeV2.sol/contract.FastBridgeV2.html#dispute_period) has passed without any disputes, the funds in escrow from the original bridge transaction can be released via a [claim] transaction, which will reimburse the rightful [Relayer].


### Guards

During the dispute period, off-chain [Guard] entities provide the security function of evaluating the [relay] asserted by the [prove]:

- Does the asserted [relay] transaction exist in a finalized state on the destination chain?

- Do all [BridgeTransactionV2] parameters of the destination [relay] match the origin bridge?

- Is the `relayer` asserted by the [prove] the same as the `relayer` of the [relay]?

If any discrepancies are found, the [Guard] will execute a [dispute].


### Effects of a [dispute] Transaction

When a [dispute] is executed, it effectively negates/erases the [proof] which was asserted by the disputed [prove] transaction.

This allows for a new corrected [prove] to be submitted and the process begins again.

If a [relay] truly did occur for the disputed [prove], but it was not for the correct bridge parameters, this constitutes an [invalid relay](/docs/RFQ/Relaying/riskFactors#invalid-relays).

Additionally, a [BridgeProofDisputed](https://rfq-contracts.synapseprotocol.com/contracts/interfaces/IFastBridge.sol/interface.IFastBridge.html#bridgeproofdisputed) event will be emitted.

This event can be useful for monitoring / alerting.
