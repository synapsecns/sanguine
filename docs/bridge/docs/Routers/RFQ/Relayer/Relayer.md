## Architecture

The RFQ Relayer is a Golang application which pairs on-chain events with stored message states to process transactions.

The canonical RFQ Relayer handles three event loops:

| Task      | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Quote**     | Track on-chain and in-flight balances, and continuously post quotes with these balances. Adjust quotes accordiing to the solverâ€™s configurations and update the API.
| **Relay**     | Fulfill [bridge requests](https://vercel-rfq-docs.vercel.app/contracts/interfaces/IFastBridge.sol/interface.IFastBridge.html#bridgerequested). Once eligible, claim user funds from the origin chain.
| **Rebalance** | For cases where flows are mono-directional, the Relayer provides an interface for rebalancing funds.

### Quote
The quote loop is relatively simple and updates the [API](../API) on each route it supports. Quotes are posted using the following requirements:

 * **Quote at or below available balance**: Available balance is determined by `balanceOnChain - inFlightFunds`.
   * If a token is the gas token, `minimumGasTokenAmount` is also subtracted.
   * Abouts below `min_quote_amount` specified in the config will not post.
 * **Quote offset**: A percentage of the token price, used to ensure the relayer is profitable. Quote offset is added to the token price to determine the quote.
 * **Fee**: `fixed_fee_multiplier` in the config is multiplied by the `origin_gas_estimate` and `destination_gas_estimate` to determine the fee, and added to the quote price.

### Relay

The relay loop is responsible for relaying funds on-chain. It listens to on-chain events and database updates to move transactions through the following states:

| State | Description
|-|-
| `Seen` | [`BridgeRequested`](https://vercel-rfq-docs.vercel.app/contracts/interfaces/IFastBridge.sol/interface.IFastBridge.html#bridgerequested) event stored in the db.
| `WillNotProcess` | [`BridgeRequested`](https://vercel-rfq-docs.vercel.app/contracts/interfaces/IFastBridge.sol/interface.IFastBridge.html#bridgerequested) event is invalid
| `NotEnoughInventory` | Retry later
| `CommittedPending` | All checks pass, waiting for transaction to finalize
| `CommittedConfirmed` | Transaction is finalized on-chain
| `RelayPending` | Called [`relay`](https://vercel-rfq-docs.vercel.app/contracts/FastBridge.sol/contract.FastBridge.html#relay)
| `RelayComplete` | Relay completed on-chain
| `ProvePosting` | Called [`prove`](https://vercel-rfq-docs.vercel.app/contracts/FastBridge.sol/contract.FastBridge.html#prove)
| `ClaimPending` | Called [`claim`](https://vercel-rfq-docs.vercel.app/contracts/FastBridge.sol/contract.FastBridge.html#claim)
| `ClaimComplete` | Dispute period expired, funds received.

### Rebalance

Automated rebalancing is configurable by token and currently supports CCTP routes as well as native bridging on Scroll. Rebalancing evaluation follows this logic every `rebalance_interval`:

For each supported rebalance method, calculate the `total_balance` of each token across the chains that support that rebalance method, and which tokens have a balance below `total_balance * maintenance_balance_pct`.

:::note

To limit in-flight inventory, only one rebalance can be pending at a time for each token. We select the 'best' rebalance candidate as the rebalance with the largest delta between origin and destination balance.

:::

The rebalance amount is the smaller of the maximum rebalance amount on origin, and minimum rebalance amount on destination, clamped to the `min` and `max` values in the configuration file.

#### Example

| # | CCTP | USDC | `maintenence_pct` | `initial_pct`
|-|-|-|-|-
| 1 | Yes | 20% | 40% | 100 USDC
| 2 | Yes | 20% | 40% | 900 USDC
| 3 | No  | 20% | 40% | 2000 USDC

<!-- We are dealing with chains 1, 2, and 3. Chains 1 and 2 support USDC with CCTP, and chain 3 supports USDC but does not support CCTP. Each chain has a `maintenance_pct` of 20%, while chains 1 and 2 have `initial_pct` of 40% and chain 3 has 20%. Assume chain 1 has a balance of 100 USDC, chain 2 has 900 USDC, and chain 3 has 2000 USDC. -->

The total balance of CCTP-supported chains is `1000 USDC`. Since chain 1, with 10% of the total inventory, is below the 20% maintenance threshold, the system triggers a rebalance from Chain 2 to Chain 1.

Chain 3 does not support CCTP, and is not considered for rebalance.

The maximum rebalance amount is `600 USDC` which takes chain 2 to its 40% initial threshold

`300 USDC` is sent from chain 2 to chain 1 is, which is the minimum required to reach chain 1's initial 40% threshold.

<!-- 1. At `rebalance_interval`, check the `maintenance_balance_pct` of each token on each chain and compare it to the current balance. If the balance is below the `maintenance_balance_pct`, continue
2. Calculate the amount to rebalance by taking the difference between the maintenance balance and the current balance and multiplying it by the `initial_balance_pct`.
3. If the amount to rebalance is greater than the `max_rebalance_amount`, set the amount to rebalance to the `max_rebalance_amount`. If the amount to rebalance is less than the `min_rebalance_amount`, do not rebalance.
4. Repeat after `rebalance_interval` -->

:::note Scroll

Rebalancing for certain native bridges (e.g Scroll) is supported. It works slightly differently as flows are only supported between Scroll and Mainnet.

At a high level, the rebalancer checks inventory on Scroll versus other chains, and if imbalanced, initiates a bridge to mainnet, allowing the CCTP relayer to rebalance funds where needed.

## Running a Relayer

### Configure

To run an RFQ Relayer, first create your [YAML configuration file](#configuration-file), Which is required as part of the `run` command.

### From Docker

Run the Docker [image](https://github.com/synapsecns/sanguine/pkgs/container/sanguine%2Frfq-relayer) along with the path to your [YAML configuration file](#configuration-file).

1. `docker run ghcr.io/synapsecns/sanguine/rfq-relayer:latest --config /path/to/config`

### From Source

:::note Requires Go 1.21 or higher

Not generally recommended for end-users.

:::

To build the relayer from source, you will need to have Go installed. You can install Go by following the instructions [here](https://golang.org/doc/install). Once you have Go installed, you can build the relayer by running the following commands:

1. `git clone https://github.com/synapsecns/sanguine --recursive`
2. `cd sanguine/services/rfq/relayer`
3. `go run main.go --config /path/to/config.yaml`

### Withdrawals

The `POST /withdraw` endpoint is exposed to allow for withdrawing from the relayer wallet without having to deal with the private key directly. This can be used for manual rebalancing, if desired. To use this feature, the following config values must be set:

```yaml
enable_api_withdrawals: true
withdrawal_whitelist:
  - <your_address_here>
```

The relayer CLI (at `services/rfq/relayer/main.go`) exposes a withdrawal command for convenience:

```bash
go run main.go withdraw --relayer-url https://localhost:8081 --chain-id 1 --amount 1000000000000000000 --token-address 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE --to 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

Be sure to sub in your respective `to` address!

<!-- TODO: this should work the same way as the openapi doc gen where its autogenerated from code and  amix-in  -->

 - `submitter_config`  - This is covered [here](/docs/Services/Submitter#Observability). At a high level this controls gas parameters used for on-chain transactions.
 - `database` - The database settings for the API backend. A database is required to store quotes and other information. Using SQLite with a dsn set to a `/tmp/` directory is recommended for development.
   -  `type` - the database driver to use, can be `mysql` or `sqlite`.
   -  `dsn` - the dsn of your database. If using sqlite, this can be a path, if using mysql please see [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-odbc/en/connector-odbc-configuration.html) for more information.
 - `screener_api_url` (optional) -  Please see [here](https://github.com/synapsecns/sanguine/tree/master/contrib/screener-api#screening-api) for an api spec, this is used descision on wether to bridge to given addresses.
 - `rfq_url` - URL of the rfq api, please see the [API](../API#api-urls) page for details and the mainnet/testnet urls.
 - `omnirpc_url` - URL of omnirpc to use, Please see [here](/docs/Services/Omnirpc) for details on running an omnirpc instance.
 - `rebalance_interval` - How often to rebalance, formatted as (s = seconds, m = minutes, h = hours)
 - `relayer_api_port` - the relayer api is used to control the relayer. <!--TODO: more info here--> This api should be secured/not public.
 - `base_chain_config`: Base chain config is the default config applied for each chain if the other chains do not override it. This is covered in the chains section.
 - `enable_guard`  - Run a guard on the same instance.
 - `submit_single_quotes` - Wether to use the batch endpoint for posting quotes to the api. This can be useful for debugging.
 - `chains` - each chain has a different config that overrides base_chain_config. Here are the parameters for each chain
  - `rfq_address` - the address of the rfq contract on this chain. These addresses are available [here](/docs/Contracts/RFQ).

  - `synapse_cctp_address` (optional) - this is only applicable if **rebalance_method** is set to synapse. This is the address of the CCTP contract available [here](/docs/Contracts/CCTP).
  - `token_messenger_address` (optional) -  this is only applicable if **rebalance_method** is set to cctp. Tells the relayer to use the token messenger instead of synapse.
      <aside>
      ðŸ’¡ The choice of wether to use synapse cctp or the circle token messenger is up to the user. Synapse will take a fee but unlike the token messenger, will not spend any of the users gas.
      </aside>
  - `confirmations` - how many confirmations to wait before acting on an event. This will vary per-chain.
  - `tokens` - this is a map of token symbolâ†’token info for this chain. For example, token may be USDC, ETH, etc

    - `decimals` - number of decimals this token uses. Please verify this against the token contract itself.
    - `min_quote_amount` - smallest amount to quote for a given chain. This should be balanced against expected gas spend for a relayer to be profitable. `min_quote_amount` is to be given in decimal units (so 1000.00 is 1000)
    - `rebalance_method` - rebalance method for this particular kind of token. Some tokens may not have a rebalance method. This is either cctp or token messenger.
    - `maintenance_balance_pct` - percent of liquidity that should be maintained on the given chain for this token. If the balance is under this amount a rebalance is triggered.
    - `initial_balance_pct` - percent of liquidity to maintain after a rebalance. The total of these on all-chains should be 100.
    - `min_rebalance_amount` - amount of this token to try to rebalance
    - `max_rebalance_amount` - maximum amount of this token to try to rebalance at once
  - `quotable_tokens`:
- `quotable_tokens`: - list of [chain-id]_[token_address]:  [chain-id]_[token_address]. For example 1-0x00â€¦. could be paired with 10-0x01
    ```yaml
    "1-0x00":
    	- "1-0x01"
    ```
- `cctp_relayer_config`: See the [CCTP page](../CCTP)

### Observability

The RFQ relayer implements open telemetry for both tracing and metrics. Please see the [Observability](docs/Services/Observability) page for more info. There is also a custom [grafana dashboard](https://github.com/synapsecns/sanguine/tree/master/services/rfq/relayer/dashboards/dashboard.json) available for the relayer. We'd also highly recommend setting up the [submitter dashboard](/docs/Services/Submitter) as well.

![Relayer Grafana Dashboard](dashboard.png)

The metrics exposed by the relayer are:

- `inventory_balance`: The balance of the inventory on the chain for a given `token_name` and `relayer`.
- `quote_amount`: The amount quoted for a given `token_name` and `relayer`.
- `status_count`: The distribution of non-terminal `QuoteRequestStatus` values over time.
