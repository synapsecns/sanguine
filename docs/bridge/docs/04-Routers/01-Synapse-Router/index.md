# Synapse Router

The Synapse Router abstracts much of the complexity around liquidity based bridging and Synapse Bridge contracts into a single [`bridge()`](/docs/Bridge/SDK/#bridge) function.

<!-- The new Router is comprised of one bridge() function and three supporting functions that help to construct a bridge transaction. All of the mentioned are organized by an important struct called a “Query”. Before diving into these functions, a deeper understanding of how the bridge actually works is fundamental. -->

<!-- Find out more about Synapse intermediary tokens nUSD and nETH in the [docs](https://docs.synapseprotocol.com/reference/faq#synapse-bridge). -->

## Queries

:::note Intermediate tokens

Some Bridge transactions utilize an [intermediary token](/docs/Bridge/#pool-liquidity) (nETH, nUSD) the protocol has mint/burn permissions over.

Swaps to/from an intermediate token return an empty query.

:::

Determining an optimal route with minimal slippage and maximum output is not trivial. Synapse Router condenses this complexity into a [`Query`](https://github.com/synapsecns/synapse-contracts/blob/7bc3a579c08838d7f4c3e62954135901abb16183/contracts/bridge/libraries/BridgeStructs.sol#L12-L18), or data structure of generic swap instructions that return a `token`, and an `amountReceived`.



Given a bridgable token, a `Query` identifies on-chain “swaps” which allow the Bridge to identify the route(s) for an origin and intermediate token swap on the origin chain, and subsequent token swap on the destination chain.

Origin and destination queries are taken from the `getOriginAmountOut()` and `getDestinationAmountOut()` supporting functions, which are called for each transaction, from which your application can decide its preferred route.


<!-- See the Example Page for further information (and arguments) that the functions above require. It is imperative that the program uses the functions here to construct Queries instead of manually doing so -- this guarantees that the transaction won't be reverted for misconfigured parameters.  -->

## Constructing a Bridge transaction

:::tip Avoid manual construction

Attempting to manually construct queries may result in transactions being reverted for misconfigured parameters. Always use the Router functions below to construct your Bridge transactions.

:::

**1. Get output `tokenSymbols`**

Call `getConnectedBridgeTokens()` with your output token to receive a formatted `tokenSymbols` list.

**2. Get `originQuery` list**

Call `getOriginAmountOut()` with your input token, `tokenSymbols` list, and `amountIn`, to receive a `Query` list for the origin chain.

**3. Get `destRequest` list**

Convert each origin `Query` to a `destRequest` as seen in this example:

```js
let requests = symbols.map((value, index) => {
  let request: DestRequest = {
    symbol: value,
    amountIn: originQueries[index].minAmountOut,
  };
  return request;
});
```

**4. Get `destQuery` list**

Call `getDestinationAmoutOut()` with your `destRequest` list and output token to receive a `Query` list for the destination chain.

**5. select `originQuery` and `destQuery`**

Determine which `originQuery` and `destQuery` to use. This simple example selects the origin and destination pair with the highest output:

```js
let destQuery = maxBy(destQueries, (query) => query.minAmountOut);
let selectedIndex = destQueries.indexOf(destQuery)
let originQuery = originQueries[selectedIndex]
```

**6. Format queries and apply user settings**

Add any user settings such as `slippage`, and `deadline` to your queries, and specify a [`swapAdapter`](#swap-adapter) for the swap to use.

**7. `bridge()`**

Call `bridge()` with your selected `originQuery` and `destQuery` pair.

## Swap Adapter

:::note

SynapseRouterV1's swap adapter supports Synapse hosted pools. Future versions will allow additional adapters to support aggregators on different chains, allowing any-to-any Bridge transactions.

:::

The Synapse Adapter is a configurable wrapper that facilitates the "swap" action on the origin and destination chains, and exposes useful methods to get `Quote` and `Query` structs, supported pools, tokens, and more.
