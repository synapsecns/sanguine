# Solc Binary Management Improvements

## Security Enhancements
- Fixed file permissions to be more restrictive (0600 for files, 0750 for directories)
- Improved error handling for response body closures
- Added robust retry mechanism for temp file verification
- Added path validation to prevent potential security vulnerabilities

## Code Quality Improvements
- Reduced cyclomatic complexity in TestErrorHandling by:
  - Breaking down into smaller, focused subtests
  - Moving test helper functions to separate file
  - Improving error handling patterns
- Fixed lint issues:
  - Addressed G301, G302, G306 warnings for file permissions
  - Resolved unused function warnings
  - Improved code organization with test helpers

## Test Coverage
- Added comprehensive test cases for previously uncovered functions
- Improved concurrent download handling tests
- Added robust retry mechanism tests
- Enhanced error classification and handling tests

## Documentation
- Added detailed comments explaining test scenarios
- Documented improvements in error handling
- Added notes about security considerations

## Recent Changes
- Fixed binary fallback test by using correct NewBinaryManager constructor
- Removed explicit platform setting to allow proper auto-detection
- Updated file permissions to use package constants:
  - Replaced dirPerms with DirPerms (0750) in setupCacheDir, setupTempDir, atomicInstall
  - Replaced filePerms with FilePerms (0600) in writeResponseToFile, createAndValidateTempFile, verifyFileReadable, verifyFileAttributes
  - Replaced execPerms with ExecPerms (0750) in attemptBinaryMove, verifyAndInstall
- Improved test reliability by letting platform detection work naturally
