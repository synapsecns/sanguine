# Solc Binary Management Improvements

## Security Enhancements
- Fixed file permissions to be more restrictive (0600 for files, 0750 for directories)
- Improved error handling for response body closures
- Added robust retry mechanism for temp file verification
- Added path validation to prevent potential security vulnerabilities

## Code Quality Improvements
- Reduced cyclomatic complexity in TestErrorHandling by:
  - Breaking down into smaller, focused subtests
  - Moving test helper functions to separate file
  - Improving error handling patterns
- Fixed lint issues:
  - Addressed G301, G302, G306 warnings for file permissions
  - Resolved unused function warnings
  - Improved code organization with test helpers

## Test Coverage
- Added comprehensive test cases for previously uncovered functions
- Improved concurrent download handling tests
- Added robust retry mechanism tests
- Enhanced error classification and handling tests

## Documentation
- Added detailed comments explaining test scenarios
- Documented improvements in error handling
- Added notes about security considerations

## Recent Changes
- Fixed binary fallback test by using correct NewBinaryManager constructor
- Removed explicit platform setting to allow proper auto-detection
- Updated file permissions to use package constants:
  - Replaced dirPerms with DirPerms (0750) in setupCacheDir, setupTempDir, atomicInstall
  - Replaced filePerms with FilePerms (0600) in writeResponseToFile, createAndValidateTempFile, verifyFileReadable, verifyFileAttributes
  - Replaced execPerms with ExecPerms (0750) in attemptBinaryMove, verifyAndInstall
- Improved test reliability by letting platform detection work naturally

## Coverage Analysis Findings

### Zero Coverage Functions (0.0%)
1. handleConcurrentDownload
   - Not triggered in TestConcurrentDownloads due to semaphore limiting concurrent access
   - Need test cases for actual concurrent download collisions
   - Should remove/increase semaphore limit in tests

2. handleTempFileError
   - Not covered in TestErrorHandling
   - Missing test cases for temp file permission errors, disk space errors
   - Need to simulate various temp file error conditions

3. applyBackoffWithJitter
   - BackoffWithJitter test exists but doesn't reach implementation
   - Need to trigger actual retry scenarios with backoff
   - Should test different attempt counts and delays

### Low Coverage Functions
1. downloadFile (53.8%) and executeRequest (50.0%)
   - Missing network error scenarios
   - Need tests for timeout, connection refused
   - Need tests for invalid HTTP responses

2. atomicInstall (48.1%)
   - Missing failure modes in atomic file operations
   - Need tests for permission errors during move
   - Need tests for concurrent access during installation

3. verifyTempFile (43.5%)
   - Missing checksum verification edge cases
   - Need tests for corrupted files
   - Need tests for partial downloads

4. downloadHelper (42.9%)
   - Missing retry logic coverage
   - Need tests for temporary network issues
   - Need tests for backoff behavior

### Required Test Improvements
1. Concurrent Downloads
   - Remove/increase semaphore limit in TestConcurrentDownloads
   - Add test cases for actual concurrent access
   - Test race conditions in binary installation

2. Error Handling
   - Add comprehensive temp file error scenarios
   - Test network failures and retries
   - Test filesystem permission issues

3. Atomic Operations
   - Test concurrent access during installation
   - Test partial writes and corruption
   - Test cleanup after failed operations
