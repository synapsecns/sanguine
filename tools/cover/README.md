# Cover

The cover tool can be used to strip generated code from a profile.cov and ignore generated files. It's loosely based off of this [golangci-lint processor](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/blob/19a338706a3dfae85ec5199216532860715fd269/pkg/result/processors/autogenerated_exclude.go)
