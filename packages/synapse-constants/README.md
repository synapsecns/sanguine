This package contains the Synapse Protocol Token and Chain Constants


#



## Installation

```bash
npm install synapse-constants
```

With Yarn:

```bash
yarn add synapse-constants
```

## Usage


To restrict the assets and chains that are imported, you can create a "custom bridge list". From the set of all tokens imported from "bridgeable.ts" you can import specific tokens and use that as the custom list you use in your application. The same can be done for chains



TODO:
- add the basic structure of the token type and the chain type to show accessibility for token logos, chain logos, and any additional information.
