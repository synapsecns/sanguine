This package contains the Synapse Protocol Token and Chain Constants


#



## Installation

```bash
npm install @synapsecs/
```

## Usage

To use the constants found in the package, import the following important lists:

- chains
- bridgeable tokens


To restrict the assets and chains that are imported, you can edit the "CUSTOM bridge list" which will return only the constants added to the list. This is useful if you want to restrict bridging to certain chains or tokens.


TODO:
- add the basic structure of the token type and the chain type to show accessibility for token logos, chain logos, and any additional information
