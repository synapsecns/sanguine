# Router SDK

The Synapse SDK is the easiest way for any developer to integrate cross-chain token & liquidity transfers into their application. The SDK is built to support full-fledged frontend applications, but is fully isomorphic, able to be used both client & server-side.

<br/><br/>
<b>The Router SDK uses ethers v5.7</b>
