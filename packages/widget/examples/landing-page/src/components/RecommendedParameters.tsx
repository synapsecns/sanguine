      <p>
        The bridge widget is a React component designed for straightforward
        integration into any React-based project. Engineered for immediate
        functionality, and apart from a <code>web3Provider</code>, it requires
        no initial parameters or web3 setup to begin operation. The widget
        facilitates bridging across all networks where the Synapse Protocol is
        active.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the widget is primed for immediate use without configuration as it
        provides some basic primary and fallback JSON-RPC endpoints, we
        encourage developers to specify their own for enhanced performance. This
        can be done by including a <code>customRpcs</code> parameter in the
        format of an object with chain ids as keys and their associated RPC
        endpoints as values.
