/// # Attestation
/// Attestation structure represents the "Snapshot Merkle Tree" created from
/// every Notary snapshot accepted by the Summit contract. Attestation includes"
/// the root of the "Snapshot Merkle Tree", as well as additional metadata.
///
/// ## Steps for creation of "Snapshot Merkle Tree":
/// 1. The list of hashes is composed for states in the Notary snapshot.
/// 2. The list is padded with zero values until its length is 2**SNAPSHOT_TREE_HEIGHT.
/// 3. Values from the list are used as leafs and the merkle tree is constructed.
///
/// ## Differences between a State and Attestation
/// Similar to Origin, every derived Notary's "Snapshot Merkle Root" is saved in Summit contract.
/// The main difference is that Origin contract itself is keeping track of an incremental merkle tree,
/// by inserting the hash of the sent message and calculating the new "Origin Merkle Root".
/// While Summit relies on Guards and Notaries to provide snapshot data, which is used to calculate the
/// "Snapshot Merkle Root".
///
/// - Origin's State is "state of Origin Merkle Tree after N-th message was sent".
/// - Summit's Attestation is "data for the N-th accepted Notary Snapshot" + "agent merkle root at the
/// time snapshot was submitted" + "attestation metadata".
///
/// ## Attestation validity
/// - Attestation is considered "valid" in Summit contract, if it matches the N-th (nonce)
/// snapshot submitted by Notaries, as well as the historical agent merkle root.
/// - Attestation is considered "valid" in Origin contract, if its underlying Snapshot is "valid".
///
/// - This means that a snapshot could be "valid" in Summit contract and "invalid" in Origin, if the underlying
/// snapshot is invalid (i.e. one of the states in the list is invalid).
/// - The opposite could also be true. If a perfectly valid snapshot was never submitted to Summit, its attestation
/// would be valid in Origin, but invalid in Summit (it was never accepted, so the metadata would be incorrect).
///
/// - Attestation is considered "globally valid", if it is valid in the Summit and all the Origin contracts.
/// # Memory layout of Attestation fields
