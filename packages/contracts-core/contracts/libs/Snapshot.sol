/// # Snapshot
/// Snapshot structure represents the state of multiple Origin contracts deployed on multiple chains.
/// In short, snapshot is a list of "State" structs. See State.sol for details about the "State" structs.
///
/// ## Snapshot usage
/// - Both Guards and Notaries are supposed to form snapshots and sign `snapshot.hash()` to verify its validity.
/// - Each Guard should be monitoring a set of Origin contracts chosen as they see fit.
///   - They are expected to form snapshots with Origin states for this set of chains,
///   sign and submit them to Summit contract.
/// - Notaries are expected to monitor the Summit contract for new snapshots submitted by the Guards.
///   - They should be forming their own snapshots using states from snapshots of any of the Guards.
///   - The states for the Notary snapshots don't have to come from the same Guard snapshot,
///   or don't even have to be submitted by the same Guard.
/// - With their signature, Notary effectively "notarizes" the work that some Guards have done in Summit contract.
///   - Notary signature on a snapshot doesn't only verify the validity of the Origins, but also serves as
///   a proof of liveliness for Guards monitoring these Origins.
///
/// ## Snapshot validity
/// - Snapshot is considered "valid" in Origin, if every state referring to that Origin is valid there.
/// - Snapshot is considered "globally valid", if it is "valid" in every Origin contract.
///
/// # Snapshot memory layout
///
/// | Position   | Field       | Type  | Bytes | Description                  |
/// | ---------- | ----------- | ----- | ----- | ---------------------------- |
/// | [000..050) | states[0]   | bytes | 50    | Origin State with index==0   |
/// | [050..100) | states[1]   | bytes | 50    | Origin State with index==1   |
/// | ...        | ...         | ...   | 50    | ...                          |
/// | [AAA..BBB) | states[N-1] | bytes | 50    | Origin State with index==N-1 |

/// @dev Snapshot could be signed by both Guards and Notaries and submitted to `Summit` in order to produce Attestations
/// that could be used in ExecutionHub for proving the messages coming from origin chains that the snapshot refers to.
