# Configs

[Messaging003AgentRoot.dc.json](Messaging003AgentRoot.dc.json) is automatically generated by the deploy script and contains proofs of the agent root representing the current state of each agent on each chain.
[Messaging003.dc.json](Messaging003.dc.json) contains the configuration for the Messaging003 contract.
    agents:
        -  0: address of the guard(s).
        -  other chains: address of the notary/ies for that chain
    chainIdSummit: chainId of the Summit chain
    owner: address of the owner of the contracts. Should match deployer address for devnet.

_Note: Synchain needs no notary_, instead every Notary signature is valid on their remote chain and SynChain at the same time.
This way they could both submit snapshots to Summit, and attestations to the remote chain.
