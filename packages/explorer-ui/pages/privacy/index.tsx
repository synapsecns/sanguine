          <br />
          This Privacy Policy sets forth our policy for collecting or using
          personal or behavioral data in connection with users access and using
          of the Site.
          <br />
          3. The Information We Collect
          <br />
          Interoperability does not collect your personal information and does
          not use any automatic tracking technologies. The Interoperability
          application leverages blockchain technologies that use only public
          information available on the blockchain. You are not required to
          provide any personal information to the Site. However, the
          transactions conducted from your wallets are publicly accessible on
          blockchain networks access through the Site.
          <br />
          Interoperability does not track IP addresses. Where third parties
          collect IP addresses by default: (1) manual removal of IP tracking is
          requested, and (2) IP data is anonymization to prevent product
          analytics services from receiving IP data.
          <br />
          Interoperability uses Google Analytics for purposes of monitoring
          action on the Site. All IP addresses are anonymized.
          <br />
          Interoperability does not store personal or message information or in
          any way use information to associate or cross-associate wallet data is
          not possible.
          <br />
          Some Internet browsers include the ability to transmit "Do Not Track"
          or "DNT" signals. Since uniform standards for "DNT" signals have not
          been adopted, the Site does not currently process or respond to "DNT"
          signals.
          <br />
          Interoperability will never collect your seed phrase or private keys.
          We will never ask you to share your wallet private keys or seed
          phrase. Never trust anyone or any site that asks you to enter your
          private keys or similar security information.
          <br />
          Interoperability may collect publicly available blockchain information
          relevant to your transactions for the purpose of utilizing such
          information in, or providing such information to third-parties
          building or maintaining, analytics pages and block explorers. Such
          information will always be anonymous and never tied to any personal
          information, and will only be maintained for as long as necessary for
          the stated purpose.
          <br />
          4. Sharing of the Personal Information
          <br />
          We do not share or sell the personal information that you provide us
          with other organizations without your express consent, except as
          described in this Privacy Policy.
          <br />
          5. How we Protect and Store Information
          <br />
          The safety and security of your personal information also depends on
          you. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and
          other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any
          time. Your wallet is protected by your password, private key, and/or
          seed phrase, and we urge you to take steps to keep this and other
          Personal Information safe by not disclosing your security credentials
          or leaving your wallet open in an unsecured manner. We seek to protect
          personal information by refraining from collecting personal
          information where possible. However, these measures do not guarantee
          that your personal information will not be accessed, disclosed,
          altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server
          software. By using the Site, you acknowledge that you understand and
          agree to assume these risks.
          <br />
          6. International Transfers Of Personal Data
          <br />
          If you are a resident of the European Economic Area ("EEA") or
          Switzerland, you may have additional rights under the General Data
          Protection Regulation (the "GDPR") and other applicable law with
          respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below.
          <br />
          For this section, we use the terms "Personal Data" and "processing" as
          they are defined in the GDPR, but "Personal Data" generally means
          information that can be used to individually identify a person, and
          "processing" generally covers actions that can be performed in
          connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure.
          Interoperability will be the controller of your Personal Data
          processed in connection with the Site.

          Gitbook and Github. When you use them, the operators of the respective
          social and developer networks and may record that you are on such
          networks. This processing of your personal data lays in the
          responsibility of these networks and occurs according to their privacy
          policy. Please check with these individual social and developer
          networks regarding their privacy policies. Interoperability is not
          responsible for data collected by these networks. We only use these
