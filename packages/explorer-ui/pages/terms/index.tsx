          This website-hosted interface (the "Site") is provided by
          Interoperability Inc. ("Interoperability", "we", "our", or "us"). The
          Site provides users with an informational interface relating to a
          decentralized protocol on the Synapse messaging application that
          allows users to bridge, stake, and pool certain digital assets (the
          "Synapse Protocol" or the "Protocol"). The Site is one, but not the
          exclusive, means of constructing data inputs for purposes of accessing
          the Protocol. These Terms of Use ("Terms") explain the terms and
          conditions by which you may access and use the Site. By accessing or
          using the Site, you signify that you have read, understand, and agree
          to be bound by these Terms in their entirety. If you do not agree, you
          are not authorized to access or use the Site and should not use the
          Site.
          <br />
          PLEASE NOTE: THE "DISPUTE RESOLUTION" SECTION OF THESE TERMS CONTAINS
          AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE THAT REQUIRES DISPUTES TO BE ARBITRATED ON AN
          INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND PROHIBITS CLASS ACTION CLAIMS. IT AFFECTS HOW
          DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND THE INTEROPERABILITY ARE RESOLVED. BY
          ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS ARBITRATION
          PROVISION. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.
          <br />
          1. Modification of these Terms
          <br />
          Interoperability reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify
          these Terms from time to time. If any modifications are made, we will
          be notified by an updated to the date at the top of the Terms. A
          current version of the Terms is maintained at
          https://synapseprotocol.com. All modifications will be effective when
          they are posted, and your continued accessing of the Site will serve
          as confirmation of your acceptance of those modifications. If you do
          not agree with any modifications to these Terms, you must immediately
          stop accessing the Site.
          <br />
          2. Eligibility
          <br />
          To access or use the Site, you must be able to form a legally binding
          contract with us. Accordingly, you represent that you are at least the
          age of majority in your jurisdiction and have the full right, power,
          and authority to enter into and comply with the terms and conditions
          of these Terms on behalf of yourself and any company or legal entity
          for which you may access or use the Site.
          <br />
          You represent that your access and use of the Site will fully comply
          with all applicable laws and regulations, and that you will not access
          or use the Site to conduct, promote, or otherwise facilitate any
          illegal activity.
          <br />
          You further represent that you are not (a) the subject of economic or
          trade sanctions administered or enforced by any governmental authority
          or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted
          parties (including but not limited to the list maintained by the
          Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the
          Treasury, “OFAC”) or (b) a citizen, resident, or organized in a
          jurisdiction or territory that is the subject of comprehensive
          country-wide, territory-wide, or regional economic sanctions by the
          United States. Finally, you represent that your access and use of the
          Site will fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and
          that you will not access or use the Site to conduct, promote, or
          otherwise facilitate any illegal activity. We reserve the right to
          utilize software or other means to restrict access to the Site for
          compliance purposes with no advance warning, including, but not
          limited to, restricting access to any individual or entity on the
          Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (“SDN”) List
          maintained by OFAC. We are under no obligation to make such
          restrictions, or the rationale underlying such restrictions, public.
          If we determine in our sole and absolute discretion that you have
          breached your representations and/or obligations under this section,
          we will block your access to the Site if continued access to the Site
          could result in Interoperability being in violation, or subject to
          negative consequences, under any sanctions laws or other law or
          regulation. While the Site does not custody or hold any assets of
          users, rendering Interoperability incapable of “blocking” any
          interests in property, to the extent (in our sole and absolute
          discretion) you breach your representations and/or obligations under
          this section, Interoperability reserves the right to notify any
          relevant identifiable persons of such breach to enable the blocking of
          interests in property as required under relevant rules and
          regulations.
          <br />
          3. Proprietary Rights
          <br />
          Interoperability and its related entities own all intellectual
          property and other rights in the Site and its contents, including (but
          not limited to) software, text, images, trademarks, service marks,
          copyrights, patents, and designs. The Synapse Protocol is comprised of
          source-available software running on public distributed blockchains.
          <br />

          content and information from the Site; and (c) to cooperate with any
          law enforcement, court or government investigation or order or third
          party requesting or directing that we disclose information or content
          or information that you provide.
          <br />
          5. Privacy
          <br />
          When you use the Site, the only information we collect from you is
          your blockchain wallet address and your transaction send information.

          10. Non-Custodial and No Fiduciary Duties
          <br />
          The Site is a purely non-custodial interface, meaning you are solely

          11. Compliance Obligations
          <br />
          By accessing or using the Site, you agree that you are solely and
          entirely responsible for compliance with all laws and regulations that
          may apply to you.
          <br />
          12. Assumption of Risk
          <br />
          By accessing and using the Site, you represent that you are
          financially and technically sophisticated enough to understand the
          inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and
          blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working knowledge of the
          usage and intricacies of digital assets. You understand that
          blockchain-based transactions are irreversible.
          <br />
          You further understand that the markets for these digital assets are
          highly volatile due to factors including (but not limited to)
          adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You
          acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with
          cryptographic and blockchain-based systems are variable and may
          increase dramatically at any time. You further acknowledge and accept
          the risk that your digital assets may lose some or all of their value
          while they are supplied to the Protocol through the Site, you may
          suffer loss due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a trading
          pair or liquidity pool, and, especially in expert modes, experience
          significant price slippage and cost. You understand that anyone can
          create a token, including fake versions of existing tokens and tokens
          that falsely claim to represent projects, and acknowledge and accept
          the risk that you may mistakenly trade those or other tokens. You
          further acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these
          variables or risks, do not own or control the Protocol, and cannot be
          held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while
          accessing or using the Site. Accordingly, you understand and agree to
          assume full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using
          the Site for the purpose of interacting with the Protocol.
          <br />
          13. Third-Party Resources and Promotions
          <br />
          The Site may contain references or links to third-party resources,
          including (but not limited to) information, materials, products, or
          services, that we do not own or control. In addition, third parties
          may offer promotions related to your access and use of the Site. We do
          not endorse or assume any responsibility for any such resources or
          promotions. If you access any such resources or participate in any
          such promotions, you do so at your own risk, and you understand that
          these Terms does not apply to your dealings or relationships with any
          third parties. You expressly relieve us of any and all liability
          arising from your use of any such resources or participation in any
          such promotions.
          <br />
          14. Release of Claims
          <br />
          You expressly agree that you assume all risks in connection with your
          access and use of the Site and your interaction with the Protocol. You
          further expressly waive and release us from any and all liability,
          claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any way
          relating to your use of the Site and your interaction with the
          Protocol. If you are a California resident, you waive the benefits and
          protections of California Civil Code § 1542, which provides: "[a]
          general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or
          releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor
          at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her,
          would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor
          or released party."
          <br />
          15. Indemnity
          <br />
          You agree to hold harmless, release, defend, and indemnify us and our
          officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, and
          subsidiaries from and against all claims, damages, obligations,
          losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses arising from: (a) your access
          and use of the Site; (b) your violation of any term or condition of
          these Terms, the right of any third party, or any other applicable
          law, rule, or regulation; and (c) any other party's access and use of
          the Site with your assistance or using any device or account that you
          own or control.
          <br />
          16. Limitation of Liability
          <br />
          Under no circumstances shall we or any of our officers, directors,
          employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, or subsidiaries be liable
          to you for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential,
          or exemplary damages, including (but not limited to) damages for loss
          of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible property, arising
          out of or relating to any access or use of the Site, nor will we be
          responsible for any damage, loss, or injury resulting from hacking,
          tampering, or other unauthorized access or use of the Site or the
          information contained within it. We assume no liability or
          responsibility for any: (a) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of
          content; (b) personal injury or property damage, of any nature
          whatsoever, resulting from any access or use of the Site; (c)
          unauthorized access or use of any secure server or database in our
          control, or the use of any information or data stored therein; (d)
          interruption or cessation of function related to the Site; (e) bugs,
          viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or
          through the Site; (f) errors or omissions in, or loss or damage
          incurred as a result of the use of, any content made available through
          the Site; and (g) the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any
          third party. Under no circumstances shall we or any of our officers,
          directors, employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, or subsidiaries
          be liable to you for any claims, proceedings, liabilities,
          obligations, damages, losses, or costs in an amount exceeding the
          amount you paid to us in exchange for access to and use of the Site,
          or USD$50.00, whichever is greater. This limitation of liability
          applies regardless of whether the alleged liability is based on
          contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, and
          even if we have been advised of the possibility of such liability.
          Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or
          the limitation or exclusion of certain liabilities and damages.
          Accordingly, some of the disclaimers and limitations set forth in
          these Terms may not apply to you. This limitation of liability shall
          apply to the fullest extent permitted by law.
          <br />
          17. Dispute Resolution
          <br />
          Interoperability will use our best efforts to resolve any potential
          disputes through informal, good faith negotiations. If a potential
          dispute arises, you must contact us by sending an email to
          notices@Interoperability.com so that we can attempt to resolve it
          without resorting to formal dispute resolution. If we aren't able to
          reach an informal resolution within sixty days of your email, then you
          and we both agree to resolve the potential dispute according to the
          process set forth below.
          <br />
          Any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the Site, these
          Terms, or any other acts or omissions for which you may contend that
          we are liable, including (but not limited to) any claim or controversy
          as to arbitrability ("Dispute"), shall be finally and exclusively
          settled by arbitration under the JAMS Optional Expedited Arbitration
          Procedures. You understand that you are required to resolve all
          Disputes by binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be held on a
          confidential basis before a single arbitrator, who shall be selected
          pursuant to JAMS rules. The arbitration will be held in Kent County,
          Delaware, unless you and we both agree to hold it elsewhere. Unless we
          agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate your claims with
          those of any other party. Any judgment on the award rendered by the
          arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
          <br />
          18. Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver
          <br />
          You must bring any and all disputes against us in your individual
          capacity and not as a plaintiff in or member of any purported class
          action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other
          representative proceeding. This provision applies to class
          arbitration. You and Interoperability both agree to waive the right to
          demand a trial by jury.
          <br />
          19. Governing Law
          <br />
          You agree that the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to
          principles of conflict of laws, govern these Terms and any Dispute
          between you and us. You further agree that for purposes of venue the
          Site shall be deemed to be based solely in Kent County, Delaware, and
          that although the Site may be available in other jurisdictions, its
          availability does not give rise to general or specific personal
          jurisdiction in any forum outside of Kent County, Delaware. Any
          arbitration conducted pursuant to these Terms shall be governed by the
          JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. You agree that
          the federal courts of Delaware are the proper forum for any appeals of
          an arbitration award or for court proceedings in the event that the
          binding arbitration clause of these Terms is found to be
          unenforceable.
          <br />
          All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision,
          or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the
          benefit of all parties.
          <br />
          For the avoidance of doubt, you agree you are solely responsible for
          all interactions with any other user in connection with the Services,
          and Interoperability will have no liability or responsibility with
          respect thereto. Interoperability reserves the right, but has no
          obligation, to become involved in any way in disputes between you and
          any other user of the Site.
          <br />
          20. Entire Agreement
          <br />
          These Terms and the Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement
          between you and us with respect to the subject matter hereof. These
          Terms supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous written and oral
          agreements, communications and other understandings (if any) relating
          to the subject matter of the terms. The information provided on the
          Site is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or
          entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use
          would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to
          any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country.
          Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Site from other
          locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for
          compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are
          applicable.
