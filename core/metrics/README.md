# Metrics Package

The metrics package contains standard drivers for opentracing, profiling and metrics.You can enable this in your appplication by calling `metrics.Setup()`. This will start the metric handler defined in the `METRICS_HANDLER` environment variable. The default is `null` which is a no-op handler.

There's also a `NAME_PREFIX` environment variable that will prefix all the metrics with the value of `NAME_PREFIX`. This is useful for differentiating between different instances of the same service.

## OTLP

We do our best to support enviornment variables specified in the [Otel Spec](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/sdk-environment-variables/) and have added a few of our own. Key ones to note are:


## Jaeger

Pass in the `JAEGER_ENDPOINT` enviornment variable

## Pyroscope

Pass in the `PYROSCOPE_ENDPOINT` environment variable

## Metrics Endpoint

The metrics endpoint is exposed on `/metrics` on port `8080` by default and is compatible with prometheus. The following options control the metrics endpoint:

| Enviornment Variable   | Description                                                                 | Default    |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `METRICS_PORT_ENABLED` | Wether or not to enable the metrics endpoint.                               | `true`     |
| `METRICS_PORT`         | Port to serve metrics on.                                                   | `8080`     |
| `METRICS_PATH`         | Path to serve metrics on                                                    | `/metrics` |
| `METRICS_ALWAYS_SYNC`  | Wether or not to wait until metrics have been exported before ending a span | `false`    |

**Note: this server failing to bind to `METRICS_PORT` will not cause the application to fail to start. The error will be logged.**

## Logger

Currently, the entire sanguine codebase uses [ipfs go-log]("https://github.com/ipfs/go-log"). As pointed out in [#1521](https://github.com/synapsecns/sanguine/issues/1521), this is not a good long term solution since the logs are not currently appended to opentelemetry, and so new traces require telemtry.

In an attempt to fix this, we introduced the new context aware [otelzap logger](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/uptrace/opentelemetry-go-extra/otelzap). Since this is in beta, you ned to call `handler.ExperimentalLogger`. In a future version, we will remove the `handler.ExperimentalLogger` and replace it with `handler.Logger` and deprecate [`ipfs/go-log`](https://github.com/ipfs/go-log).

The current logger is currently depended on by a large amount of modules:

![image](assets/deps.png) so it'd be wise to keep this module out of new code until ready to do an entire go.module, and possibly it's dependencies. This should be tracked in  [#1521](https://github.com/synapsecns/sanguine/issues/1521)

### Limitations

Currently, no enviornment variables are supported for the logger. This is a known limitation and will be fixed in a future release. Things like controlling the log level, sugarring, format, etc are [not currently supported](https://pkg.go.dev/go.uber.org/zap#NewProductionConfig). These will be added as the module beocmes more stable.

Note: because both  [ipfs go-log]("https://github.com/ipfs/go-log") and [otelzap logger](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/uptrace/opentelemetry-go-extra/otelzap) depend on zap globals, in orderr to enable globals you can set `ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_ZAP_GLOBALS` to `true` in your environment. This will enable the zap globals, and you can use the `handler.Logger` to log to the global logger. This is not recommended, and will be removed in a future release.

### Using the logger

Since the logger is dependent on the `context` to derive the current span, you need to always use `logger.Ctx(ctx)` or `logger.InfoCtx`. One thing under consideration is removing the non-ctx methods
