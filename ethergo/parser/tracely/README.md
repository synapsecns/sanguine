# Tracely

Tracely is an extension of the [Tracely](https://github.com/DenrianWeiss/tracely) tool by [DenrianWeiss](https://github.com/DenrianWeiss). It was forked to add error/context bandling and hopefully add more features in the future. The intent is to merge upstream when ready to merge `feat/communication`
