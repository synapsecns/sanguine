# Tracely

Tracely is an extension of the [Tracely](https://github.com/DenrianWeiss/tracely) tool by [DenrianWeiss](https://github.com/DenrianWeiss). It was forked to add error/context bandling and hopefully add more features in the future. If you need a comprehensive solution for tracing, please see [cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cast/), as this is by no means feature complete.
